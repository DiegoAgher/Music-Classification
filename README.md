# Music-Classification
Build music classification Neural Network models using spectrograms as input data with Python 3.6 + Tensorflow + Keras

# Requirements
## Dataset and utilery
In order to get the dataset used and some utilery, you'll have to clone the fma github [repo](https://github.com/mdeff/fma)  inside this project's directory. Download the dataset on the data section of the repo and place it inside the `fma` directory.
